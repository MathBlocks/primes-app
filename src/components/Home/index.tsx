      As long as Ethereum exists, Primes will also exist. Their

      and be recognized by many generations to come:
    </p>
    <img src="/primes-13-demo.svg" alt="Prime 13 design" />
    <p>
      The Primes Collection will start with the first 1900 prime
      numbers 2,...,16381. There will only be 1900 Primes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Primes are equipped with a special power: they can "breed".
      That means they can be multiplied together, creating
      Composites:{'  '}
      <a

      .
    </p>
    <img src="/prime-breeding-demo.svg" alt="Prime breeding demo" />
    <p>
      The artwork evolves with each new generation, that is, rows
      that correspond to prime factors are passed onto the child
      after breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to unlock all Composites up to 2ยนโด = 16384. There
      can only be 14483 Composites, and these will get unlocked over
      the course of decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional rules make the game more interesting and ensure that
      the Composite supply does not grow too fast:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Composites are unique:</b> It is not possible for more
        than one of the same Composite to exist at the same time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Composites get burned</b> when they breed with a Prime or
        another Composite, e.g. when 2 and 6 breed, 6 gets burned and
        the owner receives 12. This keeps the supply the same.
      </li>
      <li>
        Similarly, if two Composites breed,{' '}
        <b>both of them get burned</b> and only the child remains.
        This deflates the supply.
      </li>
      <li>
        Primes can breed with themselves to produce their square,
        e.g. owner of 2 can directly obtain 4 through self-breeding.
        Composites cannot do this.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Breeding cooldown:</b> A Prime has to wait for 24 hours
        before it can breed again. Similarly, a Composite has to wait
        for 24 hours after it is born before it can breed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Mathematical scarcity instead of artificial scarcity:</b>{' '}
      Primes and Composites will have traits that are derived from 23
