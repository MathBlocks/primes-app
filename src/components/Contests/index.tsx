    <h1>Math Contests</h1>
    <p>
      We organize math contests periodically to keep our community
      engaged and enthusiastic about learning new topics.
    </p>
    <h2>Proof of Math</h2>
    <p>
      A biweekly math challenge with prizes that involves{' '}
      <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> style
      questions: require more than mathematical insight, i.e.
      programming, to solve. Similar to Project Euler, we will try to
      keep a ‚Äúone-minute rule‚Äù, that is, an efficient implementation
      will allow a solution to be obtained on a modestly powered
      computer in less than one minute.

    <h2>Challenge of the Day (CotD)</h2>
    <p>
      MathBlocks organizes a daily version of Proof of Math called
      Challenge of the Day, which is intended to be easier and
      solvable during the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although CotD does not have cash prizes, participants can
      receive points for solving and get featured in a leaderboard.
      This is a work in progress, stay tuned.
